# Matrix SDK Examples

In this folder you find examples for using the matrix-sdk (and its various components) to implement specific common features, each as a separate crate. You can run each of them from the root of the repository, mind you that `_` becomes `-` and the crate names are prefixed with `example-`. So to run the image bot example you can do `cargo run -p example-image-bot`.
