## Example usage of matrix-rust-sdk from WASM

You can build the example locally with:

    npm install
    npm run serve

and then visiting http://localhost:8080 in a browser should run the example!

This example is loosely based off of [this example](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/tree/master/examples/wasm_github_fetch), an example usage of `fetch` from `wasm-bindgen`.
