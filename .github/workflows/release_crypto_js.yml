# This workflow releases the `matrix-sdk-crypto-js` project.
#
# It is triggered when a new tag appears that matches
# `matrix-sdk-crypto-js-v[0-9]+.*`. This workflow builds the package
# for the binding, run its tests to ensure everything is still
# correct, and publish the package on NPM and on a newly created
# Github release.
