# when a `--target` is passed to Cargo. Historically this was not the case, and
# because of that, cross-compilation would not set the rustflags configured
# below in `target.'cfg(all())'` for them, resulting in cache invalidation.
#
# Since this is an unstable feature (enabled at the bottom of the file), this
# setting is unfortunately ignored on stable toolchains, but it's still better
# to have it apply on nightly than using the old behavior for all toolchains.
