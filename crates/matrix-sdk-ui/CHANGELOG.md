## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Bug Fixes

- Don't consider rooms in the banned state to be non-left rooms. This bug was
  introduced due to the introduction of the banned state for rooms, and the
  non-left room filter did not take the new room stat into account.
  ([#4448](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4448))
- Fix `EventTimelineItem::latest_edit_json()` when it is populated by a live
  edit. ([#4552](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4552))

### Features

- [**breaking**] `Timeline::send_attachment()` now takes a type that implements
  `Into<AttachmentSource>` instead of a type that implements `Into<PathBuf>`.
  `AttachmentSource` allows to send an attachment either from a file, or with
  the bytes and the filename of the attachment. Note that all types that
  implement `Into<PathBuf>` also implement `Into<AttachmentSource>`.
  ([#4451](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4451))

### Refactor

- [**breaking**] `Timeline::paginate_forwards` and `Timeline::paginate_backwards`
  are unified to work on a live or focused timeline.
  `Timeline::live_paginate_*` and `Timeline::focused_paginate_*` have been
  removed ([#4584](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4584)).
- [**breaking**] `Timeline::subscribe_batched` replaces
  `Timeline::subscribe`. `subscribe` has been removed in
  [#4567](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4567),
  and `subscribe_batched` has been renamed to `subscribe` in
  [#4585](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4585).

## [0.9.0] - 2024-12-18

### Bug Fixes

- Add the `m.room.create` and the `m.room.history_visibility` state events to
  the required state for the sync. These two state events are required to
  properly compute the room preview of a joined room.
  ([#4325](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4325))

### Features

- Introduce a new variant to the `UtdCause` enum tailored for device-historical
  messages. These messages cannot be decrypted unless the client regains access
  to message history through key storage (e.g., room key backups).
  ([#4375](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4375))

## [0.8.0] - 2024-11-19

### Bug Fixes

- Disable `share_pos()` inside `RoomListService`.

- `UtdHookManager` no longer re-reports UTD events as late decryptions.
  ([#3480](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3480))

- Messages that we were unable to decrypt no longer display a red padlock.
  ([#3956](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/3956))

- `UtdHookManager` no longer reports UTD events that were already reported in a
  previous session.
  ([#3519](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3519))

### Features

- Add `m.room.join_rules` to the required state.

- `EncryptionSyncService` and `Notification` are using
  `Client::cross_process_store_locks_holder_name`.

### Refactor

- [**breaking**] `Timeline::edit` now takes a `RoomMessageEventContentWithoutRelation`.

- [**breaking**] `Timeline::send_attachment` now takes an `impl Into<PathBuf>`
  for the path of the file to send.

- [**breaking**] `Timeline::item_by_transaction_id` has been renamed to
  `Timeline::local_item_by_transaction_id` (always returns local echoes).
