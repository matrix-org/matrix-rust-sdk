//! An aggregation manager for the timeline.
//!
//! An aggregation is an event that relates to another event: for instance, a
//! reaction, a poll response, and so on and so forth.
//!
//! Because of the sync mechanisms and federation, it can happen that a related
//! event is received *before* receiving the event it relates to. Those events
//! must be accounted for, stashed somewhere, and reapplied later, if/when the
//! related-to event shows up.
//!
//! In addition to that, a room's event cache can also decide to move events
//! around, in its own internal representation (likely because it ran into some
//! duplicate events). When that happens, a timeline opened on the given room
//! will see a removal then re-insertion of the given event. If that event was
//! the target of aggregations, then those aggregations must be re-applied when
//! the given event is reinserted.
//!
//! To satisfy both requirements, the [`Aggregations`] "manager" object provided
//! by this module will take care of memoizing aggregations, for the entire
//! lifetime of the timeline (or until it's [`Aggregations::clear()`]'ed by some
//! caller). Aggregations are saved in memory, and have the same lifetime as
//! that of a timeline. This makes it possible to apply pending aggregations
//! to cater for the first use case, and to never lose any aggregations in the
//! second use case.
