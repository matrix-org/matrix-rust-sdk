//! Unified API for both the Room List API and the Encryption Sync API, that
//! takes care of all the underlying details.
//!
//! This is an opiniated way to run both APIs, with high-level callbacks that
//! should be called in reaction to user actions and/or system events.
//!
//! The room list sync will signal errors via its
//! [`state`](RoomListService::state) that the user
//! MUST observe. Whenever an error/termination is observed, the user MUST call
//! [`SyncService::start()`] again to restart the room list sync.
//!
//! The encryption sync is handled separately, and it is the responsibility of
//! the `SyncService` to manage its errors. Hence, no specific actions are
//! required from the user if the encryption sync runs into errors, as it is
//! automatically restarted (unless the user explicitly asked to
//! [`SyncService::pause()`]).
//!
//! This service can be in one of three states:
//!
//! - idle: neither the encryption sync nor the room list sync are
//! running. Nothing is happening until the user asks to do something. That's
//! the initial state. Calling [`SyncService::start()`] will lead to the next
//! state. Calling [`SyncService::pause()`] is a no-op.
//! - both syncs running: both the encryption sync and the room list sync are
//!   running at the same
//! time. Calling
//! [`SyncService::start()`] is a no-op. Calling [`SyncService::pause()`] will
//! get back to the first state. If the room list sync
//! runs into an error, it stops, and the sync service runs into the third
//! state:
//! - only the encryption sync is running: in that state, the room list sync
//!   isn't running. Calling
//! [`SyncService::start()`] will lead to the second state, while
//! [`SyncService::pause()`] will lead to the first state.
