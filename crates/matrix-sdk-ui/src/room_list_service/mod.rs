//! `RoomListService` API.
//!
//! The `RoomListService` is a UI API dedicated to present a list of Matrix
//! rooms to the user. The syncing is handled by [`SlidingSync`]. The idea is to
//! expose a simple API to handle most of the client app use cases, like:
//! Showing and updating a list of rooms, filtering a list of rooms, handling
//! particular updates of a range of rooms (the ones the client app is showing
//! to the view, i.e. the rooms present in the viewport) etc.
//!
//! As such, the `RoomListService` works as an opinionated state machine. The
//! states are defined by [`State`]. Actions are attached to the each state
//! transition. Apart from that, one can apply [`Input`]s on the state machine,
//! like notifying that the client app viewport of the room list has changed (if
//! the user of the client app has scrolled in the room list for example) etc.
//!
//! The API is purposely small. Sliding Sync is versatile. `RoomListService` is
//! _one_ specific usage of Sliding Sync.
//!
//! # Basic principle
//!
//! `RoomListService` works with 2 Sliding Sync List:
//!
//! * `all_rooms` (referred by the constant [`ALL_ROOMS_LIST_NAME`]) is the main
//!   list. Its goal is to load all the user' rooms. It starts with a
//!   [`SlidingSyncMode::Selective`] sync-mode with a small range (i.e. a small
//!   set of rooms) to load the first rooms quickly, and then updates to a
//!   [`SlidingSyncMode::Growing`] sync-mode to load the remaining rooms “in the
//!   background”: it will sync the existing rooms and will fetch new rooms, by
//!   a certain batch size.
//! * `visible_rooms` (referred by the constant [`VISIBLE_ROOMS_LIST_NAME`]) is
//!   the “reactive” list. Its goal is to react to the client app user actions.
//!   If the user scrolls in the room list, the `visible_rooms` will be
//!   configured to sync for the particular range of rooms the user is actually
//!   seeing (the rooms in the current viewport). `visible_rooms` has a
//!   different configuration than `all_rooms` as it loads more timeline events:
//!   it means that the room will already have a “history”, a timeline, ready to
//!   be presented when the user enters the room.
//!
//! This behavior has proven to be empirically satisfying to provide a fast and
//! fluid user experience for a Matrix client.
//!
//! [`RoomListService::all_rooms`] provides a way to get a [`RoomList`] for all
//! the rooms. From that, calling [`RoomList::entries`] provides a way to get a
//! stream of room list entry. This stream can be filtered, and the filter can
//! be changed over time.
//!
//! [`RoomListService::state`] provides a way to get a stream of the state
//! machine's state, which can be pretty helpful for the client app.
