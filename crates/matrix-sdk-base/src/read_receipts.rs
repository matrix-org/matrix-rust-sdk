//! # Client-side read receipts computation
//!
//! While Matrix servers have the ability to provide basic information about the
//! unread status of rooms, via [`crate::sync::UnreadNotificationsCount`], it's
//! not reliable for encrypted rooms. Indeed, the server doesn't have access to
//! the content of encrypted events, so it can only makes guesses when
//! estimating unread and highlight counts.
//!
//! Instead, this module provides facilities to compute the number of unread
//! messages, unread notifications and unread highlights in a room.
//!
//! Counting unread messages is performed by looking at the latest receipt of
//! the current user, and inferring which events are following it, according to
//! the sync ordering.
//!
//! For notifications and highlights to be precisely accounted for, we also need
//! to pay attention to the user's notification settings. Fortunately, this is
//! also something we need to for notifications, so we can reuse this code.
//!
//! Of course, not all events are created equal, and some are less interesting
//! than others, and shouldn't cause a room to be marked unread. This module's
//! `marks_as_unread` function shows the opiniated set of rules that will filter
//! out uninterested events.
//!
//! The only `pub(crate)` method in that module is `compute_unread_counts`,
//! which updates the `RoomInfo` in place according to the new counts.
//!
//! ## Implementation details: How to get the latest receipt?
//!
//! ### Preliminary context
//!
//! We do have an unbounded, in-memory cache for sync events, as part of sliding
//! sync. It's reset as soon as we get a "limited" (gappy) sync for a room. Not
//! as ideal as an on-disk timeline, but it's sufficient to do some interesting
//! computations already.
//!
//! ### How-to
//!
//! When we call `compute_unread_counts`, that's for one of two reasons (and
//! maybe both at once, or maybe none at all):
//! - we received a new receipt
//! - new events came in.
//!
//! A read receipt is considered _active_ if it's been received from sync
//! *and* it matches a known event in the in-memory sync events cache.
//!
//! The *latest active* receipt is the one that's active, with the latest order
//! (according to sync ordering, aka position in the sync cache).
//!
//! The problem of keeping a precise read count is thus equivalent to finding
//! the latest active receipt, and counting interesting events after it (in the
//! sync ordering).
//!
//! When we get new events, we'll incorporate them into an inverse mapping of
//! event id -> sync order (`event_id_to_pos`). This gives us a simple way to
//! select a "better" active receipt, using the `ReceiptSelector`. An event that
//! has a read receipt can be passed to `ReceiptSelector::try_select_later`,
//! which compares the order of the current best active, to that of the new
//! event, and records the better one, if applicable.
//!
//! When we receive a new receipt event in
//! `ReceiptSelector::handle_new_receipt`, if we find a {public|private}
//! {main-threaded|unthreaded} receipt attached to an event, there are two
//! possibilities:
//! - we knew the event, so we can immediately try to select it as a better
//!   event with `try_select_later`,
//! - or we don't, which may mean the receipt refers to a past event we lost
//!   track of (because of a restart of the app — remember the cache is mostly
//!   memory-only, and a few items on disk), or the receipt refers to a future
//!   event. To cover for the latter possibility, we stash the receipt and mark
//!   it as pending (we only keep a limited number of pending read receipts
//!   using a `RingBuffer`).
//!
//! That means that when we receive new events, we'll check if their id matches
//! one of the pending receipts in `handle_pending_receipts`; if so, we can
//! remove it from the pending set, and try to consider it a better receipt with
//! `try_select_later`. If not, it's still pending, until it'll be forgotten or
//! matched.
//!
//! Once we have a new *better active receipt*, we'll save it in the
//! `RoomReadReceipt` data (stored in `RoomInfo`), and we'll compute the counts,
//! starting from the event the better active receipt was referring to.
//!
//! If we *don't* have a better active receipt, that means that all the events
//! received in that sync batch aren't referred to by a known read receipt,
//! _and_ we didn't get a new better receipt that matched known events. In that
//! case, we can just consider that all the events are new, and count them as
//! such.
//!
//! ### Edge cases
//!
//! - `compute_unread_counts` is called after receiving a sliding sync response,
//!   at a time where we haven't tried to "reconcile" the cached timeline items
//!   with the new ones. The only kind of reconciliation we'd do anyways is
//!   clearing the timeline if it was limited, which equates to having common
//!   events ids in both sets. As a matter of fact, we have to manually handle
//!   this edge case here. I hope that having an event database will help avoid
//!   this kind of workaround here later.
//! - In addition to that, and as noted in the timeline code, it seems that the
//!   sliding-sync proxy could return the same event multiple times in a sync
//!   timeline, leading to incorrect results. We have to take that into account
//!   by resetting the read counts *every* time we see an event that was the
//!   target of the latest active read receipt.
