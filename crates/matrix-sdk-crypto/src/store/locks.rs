//! Collection of small helpers that implement store-based locks.
//!
//! This is a per-process lock that may be used only for very specific use
//! cases, where multiple processes might concurrently write to the same
//! database at the same time; this would invalidate crypto store caches, so
//! that should be done mindfully. Such a lock can be acquired multiple times by
//! the same process, and it remains active as long as there's at least one user
//! in a given process.
//!
//! The lock is implemented using time-based leases to values inserted in a
//! crypto store. The store maintains the lock identifier (key), who's the
//! current holder (value), and an expiration timestamp on the side; see also
//! `CryptoStore::try_take_leased_lock` for more details.
//!
//! The lock is initially acquired for a certain period of time (namely, the
//! duration of a lease, aka `LEASE_DURATION_MS`), and then a "heartbeat" task
//! renews the lease to extend its duration, every so often (namely, every
//! `EXTEND_LEASE_EVERY_MS`). Since the tokio scheduler might be busy, the
//! extension request should happen way more frequently than the duration of a
//! lease, in case a deadline is missed. The current values have been chosen to
//! reflect that, with a ratio of 1:10 as of 2023-06-23.
//!
//! Releasing the lock happens naturally, by not renewing a lease. It happens
//! automatically after the duration of the last lease, at most.
