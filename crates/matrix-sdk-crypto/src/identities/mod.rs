//! Collection of public identities used in Matrix.
//!
//! Matrix supports two main types of identities, a per-device identity and a
//! per-user identity.
//!
//! ## Device
//!
//! Every E2EE capable Matrix client will create a new Olm account and upload
//! the public keys of the Olm account to the server. This is represented as a
//! `ReadOnlyDevice`.
//!
//! Devices can have a local trust state which is needs to be saved in our
//! `CryptoStore`, to avoid reference cycles a wrapper for the `ReadOnlyDevice`
//! exists which adds methods to manipulate the local trust state.
//!
//! ## User
//!
//! Cross-signing capable devices will upload 3 additional (master,
//! self-signing, user-signing) public keys which represent the user identity
//! owning all the devices. This is represented in two ways, as a `UserIdentity`
//! for other users and as `OwnUserIdentity` for our own user.
//!
//! This is done because the server will only give us access to 2 of the 3
//! additional public keys for other users, while it will give us access to all
//! 3 for our own user.
//!
//! Both identity sets need to regularly fetched from the server using the
//! `/keys/query` API call.
