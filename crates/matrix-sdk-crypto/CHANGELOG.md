Changes:

- Add message IDs to all outgoing to-device messages encrypted by
  `matrix-sdk-crypto`. The `message-ids` feature of `matrix-sdk-crypto` and
  `matrix-sdk-base` is now a no-op.
  ([#3776](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3776))

- Log the content of received `m.room_key.withheld` to-device events.
  ([#3591](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3591))

- Attempt to decrypt bundled events (reactions and the latest thread reply) if
  they are found in the unsigned part of an event.
  ([#3468](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3468))

- Sign the device keys with the user-identity (i.e. cross-signing keys) if
  we're uploading the device keys and if the cross-signing keys are available.
  This approach eliminates the need to upload signatures in a separate request,
  ensuring that other users/devices will never encounter this device without a
  signature from their user identity. Consequently, they will never see the
  device as unverified.
  ([#3453](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3453))

- Avoid emitting entries from `identities_stream_raw` and `devices_stream` when
  we receive a `/keys/query` response which shows that no devices changed.
  ([#3442](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3442))

- Fallback keys are rotated in a time-based manner, instead of waiting for the
  server to tell us that a fallback key got used.
  ([#3151](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3151))

Breaking changes:

  **NOTE**: this version causes changes to the format of the serialised data in
  the CryptoStore, meaning that, once upgraded, it will not be possible to roll
  back applications to earlier versions without breaking user sessions.

- Change the structure of the `SenderData` enum to separate variants for
  previously-verified, unverified and verified.
  ([#3877](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3877))

- Where `EncryptionInfo` is returned it may include the new `PreviouslyVerified`
  variant of `VerificationLevel` to indicate that the user was previously
  verified and is no longer verified.
  ([#3877](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3877))

- Expose new methods `OwnUserIdentity::was_previously_verified`,
  `OwnUserIdentity::withdraw_verification`, and
  `OwnUserIdentity::has_verification_violation`, which track whether our own
  identity was previously verified.
  ([#3846](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3846))

- Add a new `error_on_verified_user_problem` property to
  `CollectStrategy::DeviceBasedStrategy`, which, when set, causes
  `OlmMachine::share_room_key` to fail with an error if any verified users on
  the recipient list have unsigned devices, or are no lonver verified.

  Also remove `CollectStrategy::new_device_based`: callers should construct a
  `CollectStrategy::DeviceBasedStrategy` directly.

  `EncryptionSettings::new` now takes a `CollectStrategy` argument, instead of
  a list of booleans.
  ([#3810](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3810))
  ([#3816](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3816))

- Remove the method `OlmMachine::clear_crypto_cache()`, crypto stores are not
  supposed to have any caches anymore.

- Add a `custom_account` argument to the `OlmMachine::with_store()` method, this
  allows users to learn their identity keys before they get access to the user
  and device ID.
  ([#3451](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3451))

- Add a `backup_version` argument to `CryptoStore`'s
  `inbound_group_sessions_for_backup`,
  `mark_inbound_group_sessions_as_backed_up` and
  `inbound_group_session_counts` methods.
  ([#3253](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3253))

- Rename the `OlmMachine::invalidate_group_session` method to
  `OlmMachine::discard_room_key`

- Move `OlmMachine::export_room_keys` to `matrix_sdk_crypto::store::Store`.
  (Call it with `olm_machine.store().export_room_keys(...)`.)

- Add new `dehydrated` property to `olm::account::PickledAccount`.
  ([#3164](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3164))

- Remove deprecated `OlmMachine::import_room_keys`.
  ([#3448](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3448))

- Add the `SasState::Created` variant to differentiate the state between the
  party that sent the verification start and the party that received it.

Deprecations:

- Deprecate `BackupMachine::import_backed_up_room_keys`.
  ([#3448](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3448))

Additions:

- Expose new method `OlmMachine::room_keys_withheld_received_stream`, to allow
  applications to receive notifications about received `m.room_key.withheld`
  events.
  ([#3660](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3660)),
  ([#3674](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3674))

- Expose new method `OlmMachine::clear_crypto_cache()`, with FFI bindings
  ([#3462](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3462))

- Expose new method `OlmMachine::upload_device_keys()`.
  ([#3457](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3457))

  ([#3448](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3448))

- Expose new method `BackupMachine::backup_version`.
  ([#3320](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3320))

- Add data types to parse the QR code data for the QR code login defined in
  [MSC4108](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4108)

- Expose new method `CryptoStore::clear_caches`.
  ([#3338](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3338))

- Expose new method `OlmMachine::device_creation_time`.
  ([#3275](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3275))

- Log more details about the Olm session after encryption and decryption.
  ([#3242](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3242))

- When Olm message decryption fails, report the error code(s) from the failure.
  ([#3212](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3212))

- Expose new methods `OlmMachine::set_room_settings` and
  `OlmMachine::get_room_settings`.
  ([#3042](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3042))

- Add new properties `session_rotation_period` and
  `session_rotation_period_msgs` to `store::RoomSettings`.
  ([#3042](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3042))

- Fix bug which caused `SecretStorageKey` to incorrectly reject secret storage
  keys whose metadata lacked check fields.
  ([#3046](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3046))

- Add new API `Device::encrypt_event_raw` that allows
  to encrypt an event to a specific device.
  ([#3091](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3091))

- Add new API `store::Store::export_room_keys_stream` that provides room
  keys on demand.

- Include event timestamps on logs from event decryption.

# 0.7.2

### Security Fixes

- Fix `UserIdentity::is_verified` to take into account our own identity
  [#d8d9dae](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/d8d9dae9d77bee48a2591b9aad9bd2fa466354cc) (Moderate, [GHSA-4qg4-cvh2-crgg](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-4qg4-cvh2-crgg)).

# 0.7.1
### Security Fixes

- Don't log the private part of the backup key, introduced in [#71136e4](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/71136e44c03c79f80d6d1a2446673bc4d53a2067).

# 0.7.0

- Add method to mark a list of inbound group sessions as backed up:
  `CryptoStore::mark_inbound_group_sessions_as_backed_up`

- `OlmMachine::toggle_room_key_forwarding` is replaced by two separate methods:

  * `OlmMachine::set_room_key_requests_enabled`, which controls whether
    outgoing room key requests are enabled, and:

  * `OlmMachine::set_room_key_forwarding_enabled`, which controls whether we
    automatically reply to incoming room key requests.

  `OlmMachine::is_room_key_forwarding_enabled` is updated to return the setting
  of `OlmMachine::set_room_key_forwarding_enabled`, while
  `OlmMachine::are_room_key_requests_enabled` is added to return the setting of
  `OlmMachine::set_room_key_requests_enabled`.

  ([#2902](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2902))

- Improve performance of `share_room_key`.
  ([#2862](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2862))

- `get_missing_sessions`: Don't block waiting for `/keys/query` requests on
  blacklisted servers, and improve performance.
  ([#2845](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2845))

- Generalize `olm::Session::encrypt` to accept any value implementing
  `Serialize` for the `value` parameter, instead of specifically
  `serde_json::Value`. Note that references to `Serialize`-implementing types
  themselves implement `Serialize`.

- Change the argument to `OlmMachine::receive_sync_changes` to be an
  `EncryptionSyncChanges` struct packing all the arguments instead of many
  single arguments. The new `next_batch_token` field there should be the
  `next_batch` value read from the latest sync response.

- Handle missing devices in `/keys/claim` responses.
  ([#2805](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2805))

- Add the higher level decryption method `decrypt_session_data` to the
  `BackupDecryptionKey` type.

- Add a higher level method to create signatures for the backup info. The
  `OlmMachine::backup_machine()::sign_backup()` method can be used to add
  signatures to a `RoomKeyBackupInfo`.

- Remove the `backups_v1` feature, backups support is now enabled by default.

- Use the `Signatures` type as the return value for the
  `MegolmV1BackupKey::signatures()` method.

- Add two new methods to import room keys,
  `OlmMachine::store()::import_exported_room_keys()` for file exports and
  `OlmMachine::backup_machine()::import_backed_up_room_keys()` for backups. The
  `OlmMachine::import_room_keys()` method is now deprecated.

- The parameter order of `OlmMachine::encrypt_room_event_raw` and
  `OutboundGroupSession::encrypt` has changed, `content` is now last
  - The parameter type of `content` has also changed, from `serde_json::Value`
    to `&Raw<AnyMessageLikeEventContent>`

- Change the return value of `bootstrap_cross_signing` so it returns an extra
  keys upload request.  The three requests must be sent in the order they
  appear in the return tuple.

- Stop logging large quantities of data about the `Store` during olm
  decryption.

- Remove spurious "Unknown outgoing secret request" warning which was logged
  for every outgoing secret request.

- Clean up the logging of to-device messages in `share_room_key`.

- Expose new `OlmMachine::get_room_event_encryption_info` method.

- Add support for secret storage.

- Add initial support for MSC3814 - dehydrated devices.

- Mark our `OwnUserIdentity` as verified if we successfully import the matching
  private keys.

- The `OlmMachine::export_cross_signing_keys()` method now returns a `Result`.
  This removes an `unwrap()` from the codebase.

- Add support for the `hkdf-hmac-sha256.v2` SAS message authentication code.

- Ensure that the correct short authentication strings are used when accepting a
  SAS verification with the `Sas::accept()` method.

- Add a new optional `message-ids` feature which adds a unique ID to the content
  of `m.room.encrypted` event contents which get sent out.

- Disable the automatic-key-forwarding feature by default.

- Add a new variant to the `VerificationRequestState` enum called
  `Transitioned`. This enum variant is used when a `VerificationRequest`
  transitions into a concrete `Verification` object. The concrete `Verification`
  object is given as associated data in the `Transitioned` enum variant.

- Replace the libolm backup encryption code with a native Rust version. This
  adds WASM support to the backups_v1 feature.

- Add new API `store::Store::room_keys_received_stream` to provide
  updates of room keys being received.

- Add new method `identities::device::Device::first_time_seen_ts`
  that allows to get a local timestamp of when the device was first seen by
  the sdk (in seconds since epoch).

- When rejecting a key-verification request over to-device messages, send the
  `m.key.verification.cancel` to the device that made the request, rather than
  broadcasting to all devices.

- Expose `VerificationRequest::time_remaining`.

- For verification-via-emojis, return the word "Aeroplane" rather than
  "Airplane", for consistency with the Matrix spec.

- Fix handling of SAS verification start events once we have shown a QR code.

- Fix a bug which could cause generated one-time-keys not to be persisted.

- Fix parsing error for `POST /_matrix/client/v3/keys/signatures/upload`
  responses generated by Synapse.

- Add new API `OlmMachine::query_keys_for_users` for generating out-of-band key
  queries.

- Rename "recovery key" to "backup decryption key" to avoid confusion with the
  secret-storage key which is also known as a recovery key.

  This affects the `matrix_sdk_crypto::store::RecoveryKey` struct itself (now
  renamed to `BackupDecryptionKey`, as well as
  `BackupMachine::save_recovery_key` (now `save_decryption_key`).

- Change the returned success value type of `BackupMachine::backup` from
  `OutgoingRequest` to `(OwnedTransactionId, KeysBackupRequest)`.
