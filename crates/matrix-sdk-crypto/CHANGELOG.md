# unreleased

- Add support for secret storage.

- Add initial support for MSC3814 - dehydrated devices.

- Mark our `OwnUserIdentity` as verified if we successfully import the matching
  private keys.

- The `OlmMachine::export_cross_signing_keys()` method now returns a `Result`.
  This removes an `unwrap()` from the codebase.

- Add support for the `hkdf-hmac-sha256.v2` SAS message authentication code.

- Ensure that the correct short authentication strings are used when accepting a
  SAS verification with the `Sas::accept()` method.

- Add a new optional `message-ids` feature which adds a unique ID to the content
  of `m.room.encrypted` event contents which get sent out.

- Disable the automatic-key-forwarding feature by default.

- Add a new variant to the `VerificationRequestState` enum called
  `Transitioned`. This enum variant is used when a `VerificationRequest`
  transitions into a concrete `Verification` object. The concrete `Verification`
  object is given as associated data in the `Transitioned` enum variant.

- Replace the libolm backup encryption code with a native Rust version. This
  adds WASM support to the backups_v1 feature.

- Add new API `store::Store::room_keys_received_stream` to provide
  updates of room keys being received.

- Add new method `identities::device::Device::first_time_seen_ts`
  that allows to get a local timestamp of when the device was first seen by
  the sdk (in seconds since epoch).

- When rejecting a key-verification request over to-device messages, send the
  `m.key.verification.cancel` to the device that made the request, rather than
  broadcasting to all devices.

- Expose `VerificationRequest::time_remaining`.

- For verification-via-emojis, return the word "Aeroplane" rather than
  "Airplane", for consistency with the Matrix spec.

- Fix handling of SAS verification start events once we have shown a QR code.

- Fix a bug which could cause generated one-time-keys not to be persisted.

- Fix parsing error for `POST /_matrix/client/v3/keys/signatures/upload`
  responses generated by Synapse.

- Add new API `OlmMachine::query_keys_for_users` for generating out-of-band key
  queries.

- Rename "recovery key" to "backup decryption key" to avoid confusion with the
  secret-storage key which is also known as a recovery key.

  This affects the `matrix_sdk_crypto::store::RecoveryKey` struct itself (now
  renamed to `BackupDecryptionKey`, as well as
  `BackupMachine::save_recovery_key` (now `save_decryption_key`).

- Change the returned success value type of `BackupMachine::backup` from
  `OutgoingRequest` to `(OwnedTransactionId, KeysBackupRequest)`.

- Expose new `OlmMachine::get_room_event_encryption_info` method.

- Clean up the logging of to-device messages in `share_room_key`.

- Remove spurious "Unknown outgoing secret request" warning which was logged
  for every outgoing secret request.
