//! An implementation of `deadpool` for `rusqlite`.
//!
//! Initially, we were using `deadpool-sqlite`, that is also using `rusqlite` as
//! the SQLite interface. However, in the implementation of
//! [`deadpool::managed::Manager`], when recycling an object (i.e. an SQLite
//! connection), [a SQL query is run to detect whether the connection is still
//! alive][connection-test]. It creates performance issues:
//!
//! 1. It runs a prepared SQL query, which has a non-negligle cost. Imagine each
//!    connection is used to run on average one query; when recycled, a second
//!    query was constantly run. Even if it's a simple query, it requires to
//!    prepare a statement, to run and to query it.
//! 2. The SQL query was run in a blocking task. Indeed,
//!    `deadpool_runtime::spawn_blocking` is used (via
//!    `deadpool_sync::SyncWrapper::interact`), which includes [blocking the
//!    thread, acquiring a lock][spawn_blocking] etc. All this has more
//!    performance cost.
//!
//! Measures have shown it is a performance bottleneck for us, especially on
//! Android. Why specifically on Android and not other systems? This is still
//! unclear at the time of writing (2025-11-11), despites having spent several
//! days digging and trying to find an answer to this question.
//!
//! We have tried to use another approach to test the aliveness of the
//! connections without running queries. It has involved patching `rusqlite` to
//! add more bindings to SQLite, and patching `deadpool` itself, but without any
//! successful results.
//!
//! Finally, we have started questioning the reason of this test: why testing
//! whether the connection was still alive? After all, there is no reason a
//! connection should die in our case:
//!
//! - all connections are local,
//! - all interactions are behind [WAL], which is local only,
//! - even if for an unknown reason the connection died, using it next time
//!   would create an error… exactly what would happen when recycling the
//!   connection.
//!
//! Consequently, we have created a new implementation of `deadpool` for
//! `rusqlite` that doesn't test the aliveness of the connections when recycled.
//! We assume they are all alive.
//!
//! This implementation is, at the time of writing (2025-11-11):
//!
//! - 3.5 times faster on Android than `deadpool-sqlite`, removing the lock and
//!   thread contention entirely,
//! - 2 times faster on iOS.
