## [0.19.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/tree/0.19.0) - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Add `SqliteStoreBuilder::high_entropy_passphrase`, a faster alternative to
  `SqliteStoreBuilder::passphrase` for randomly generated, high-entropy
  passphrases. Using this setting once migrates the database from a
  passphrase-based setup to a key-based setup. After the migration,
  `SqliteStoreBuilder::key` can be used instead and is equivalent to
  `SqliteStoreBuilder::high_entropy_passphrase`.

  Do **NOT** use it with human-chosen passphrases, as migrating those to a
  key-based setup would remove their brute-force protection.
  ([#6878](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6878))

### Changed

- Only keep the latest gossip request for each secret.
  ([#6631](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6631))
- The `EventId`s stored in the Event Cache database are now encrypted as hashes,
  they cannot be decrypted.

  The gap `prev_batch_token` is also encoded from a Rust `String` instead of a
  JSON representation of a `String`, saving a bit of computation and storage
  space.

  The Event Cache database is reset.
  ([#6739](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6739))
- [**breaking**] The `open_with_key()` method for the various store
  implementations now accepts a key with any length instead of a 32-byte long
  array. ([#6878](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6878))
- The `event-cache` feature flag has been split into `event-cache-store` and
  `media-store`. Both are enabled by default.
  ([#6896](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6896))
- Cleared the Sliding Sync `pos` value from the crypto store after
  [this PR](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6872) emptied the
  event cache. With this, the initial sync should at least return the most
  recent events for the rooms in the room list, which would be missing with he
  previous `pos` value and would force the clients to paginate to load _any_
  events for _any_ timeline, not even the room's latest event would be present.
  ([#7016](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/7016))

### Fixed

- Double-quotes are for SQL identifiers, while single-quotes are for string
  literals. SQLite however accepts both quotes for string literals, depending on
  some configuration. See the
  [_Double-quoted String Literals Are Accepted_ Section of the SQLite documentation][sqlite-quirks-string-literals].
  This patch fixes a bug where double-quotes were used for a string literal in a
  migration file for the crypto store.

  [sqlite-quirks-string-literals]:
  [<https://sqlite.org/quirks.html#double_quoted_string_literals_are_>][https-sqlite-org-quirks-html-double-quoted-string-literals-are]
  accepted ([#6653](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6653))
- Add a uniqueness constraint on `event_chunks` table that ensures an `Event`
  cannot be in a `LinkedChunk` more than once.
  ([#6872](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6872))
- Fix a bug in `SqliteCryptoStore::mark_inbound_group_sessions_as_backed_up`,
  `SqliteStateStore::get_profiles` and `SqliteStateStore::get_global_profiles`,
  where passing a large number of sessions or users were erroring to “too many
  SQL variables” in SQLite. This error is due to a manual misuse of the
  `repeat_vars` function in the `chunk_large_query_over` method. The fix is to
  make misuses impossible by introducing the new `ChunkFromLargeQuery` type,
  replacing the `Vec<Key>` in `chunk_large_query_over`, removing the need to
  manually use `repeat_vars`.
  ([#6946](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6946))
