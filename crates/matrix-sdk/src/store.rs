//! Functions and types to initialize a store.
//!
//! The re-exports present here depend on the store-related features that are
//! enabled:
//!
//! 1. The `sled` feature provides a `StateStore` for storing state and
//!    a `CryptoStore` for E2EE data (if `e2e-encryption` is enabled). This is
//!    the default persistent store implementation for non-WebAssembly targets.
//! 2. The `indexeddb` feature also provides a `StateStore` for storing state
//!    and a `CryptoStore` (if `e2e-encryption` is enabled). This is the default
//!    persistent store implementation for WebAssembly targets.
//!
//! Both options provide a `make_store_config` convenience method to create a
//! [`StoreConfig`] for [`ClientBuilder::store_config()`].
//!
//! [`StoreConfig`]: crate::config::StoreConfig
//! [`ClientBuilder::store_config()`]: crate::ClientBuilder::store_config

// indexeddb and sled are mutably exclusive and though that is already checked
// before, both using `*`-glob exports confuses the compiler. so we exclude
// them. see https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/553#issuecomment-325034618
