//! The event cache is an abstraction layer, sitting between the Rust SDK and a
//! final client, that acts as a global observer of all the rooms, gathering and
//! inferring some extra useful information about each room. In particular, this
//! doesn't require subscribing to a specific room to get access to this
//! information.
//!
//! It's intended to be fast, robust and easy to maintain, having learned from
//! previous endeavours at implementing middle to high level features elsewhere
//! in the SDK, notably in the UI's Timeline object.
//!
//! See the [github issue](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/3058) for more
//! details about the historical reasons that led us to start writing this.
