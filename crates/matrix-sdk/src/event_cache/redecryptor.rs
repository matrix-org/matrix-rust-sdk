//! The Redecryptor (Rd) is a layer and long-running background task which
//! handles redecryption of events in case we couldn't decrypt them imediatelly.
//!
//! Rd listens to the OlmMachine for received room keys. If a new room key has
//! been received it attempts to find any UTDs in the [`EventCache`]. If Rd
//! decrypts any UTDs from the event cache it will replace the events in the
//! cache and send out new [`RoomEventCacheUpdates`] to any of its listeners.
//!
//! There's an additional gotcha, the [`OlmMachine`] might get recreated by
//! calls to [`BaseClient::regenerate_olm()`]. When this happens we will receive
//! a `None` on the room keys stream and we need to re-listen to it.
//!
//! Another gotcha is that room keys might be received on another process if the
//! Client is operating on a iOS device. A separate process is used in this case
//! to receive push notifications. In this case the room key will be received
//! and Rd won't get notified about it. To work around this decryption requests
//! can be explicitly sent to Rd.
//!
