//! Types for the QR code login support defined in [MSC4108](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4108).
//!
//! Please note, QR code logins are only supported when using OAuth 2.0 as the
//! authentication mechanism, native Matrix authentication does not support it.
//!
//! This currently only implements the case where the new device is scanning the
//! QR code. To log in using a QR code, please take a look at the
//! [`OAuth::login_with_qr_code()`] method.
