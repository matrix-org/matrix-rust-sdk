//! Cryptographic identities used in Matrix.
//!
//! There are two types of cryptographic identities in Matrix.
//!
//! 1. Devices, which are backed by [device keys], they represent each
//! individual log in by an E2EE capable Matrix client. We represent devices
//! using the [`Device`] struct.
//!
//! 2. User identities, which are backed by [cross signing keys]. The user
//! identity represent a unique E2EE capable identity of any given user. This
//! identity is generally created and uploaded to the server by the first E2EE
//! capable client the user logs in with. We represent user identities using the
//! [`UserIdentity`] struct.
//!
//! A [`Device`] or an [`UserIdentity`] can be used to inspect the public keys
//! of the device/identity, or it can be used to initiate a interactive
//! verification flow. They can also be manually marked as verified.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Verifying a device is pretty straightforward:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::convert::TryFrom;
//! # use matrix_sdk::{Client, ruma::{device_id, user_id}};
//! # use url::Url;
//! # use futures::executor::block_on;
//! # let alice = user_id!("@alice:example.org");
//! # let homeserver = Url::parse("http://example.com").unwrap();
//! # block_on(async {
//! # let client = Client::new(homeserver).await.unwrap();
//! let device = client.encryption().get_device(alice, device_id!("DEVICEID")).await?;
//!
//! if let Some(device) = device {
//!     // Let's request the device to be verified.
//!     let verification = device.request_verification().await?;
//!
//!     // Actually this is taking too long.
//!     verification.cancel().await?;
//!
//!     // Let's just mark it as verified.
//!     device.verify().await?;
//! }
//! # anyhow::Ok(()) });
//! ```
//!
//! Verifying a user identity works largely the same:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::convert::TryFrom;
//! # use matrix_sdk::{Client, ruma::user_id};
//! # use url::Url;
//! # use futures::executor::block_on;
//! # let alice = user_id!("@alice:example.org");
//! # let homeserver = Url::parse("http://example.com").unwrap();
//! # block_on(async {
//! # let client = Client::new(homeserver).await.unwrap();
//! let user = client.encryption().get_user_identity(alice).await?;
//!
//! if let Some(user) = user {
//!     // Let's request the user to be verified.
//!     let verification = user.request_verification().await?;
//!
//!     // Actually this is taking too long.
//!     verification.cancel().await?;
//!
//!     // Let's just mark it as verified.
//!     user.verify().await?;
//! }
//! # anyhow::Ok(()) });
//! ```
