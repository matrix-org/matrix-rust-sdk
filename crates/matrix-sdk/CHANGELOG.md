## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Bug Fixes

- Use the inviter's server name and the server name from the room alias as
  fallback values for the via parameter when requesting the room summary from
  the homeserver. This ensures requests succeed even when the room being
  previewed is hosted on a federated server.
  ([#4357](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4357))

- Do not use the encrypted original file's content type as the encrypted
  thumbnail's content type.
  ([#ecf4434](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/ecf44348cf6a872b843fb7d7af1a88f724c58c3e))
### Features

- Enable persistent storage for the `EventCache`. This allows events received
  through the `/sync` endpoint or backpagination to be stored persistently,
  enabling client applications to restore a room's view, including events,
  without requiring server communication.
  ([#4347](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4347))

- [**breaking**] Make all fields of Thumbnail required
  ([#4324](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4324))

## [0.8.0] - 2024-11-19

### Bug Fixes

- Add more invalid characters for room aliases.

- Match the right status code in `Client::is_room_alias_available`.

- Fix a bug where room keys were considered to be downloaded before backups were
  enabled. This bug only affects the
  `BackupDownloadStrategy::AfterDecryptionFailure`, where no attempt would be
  made to download a room key, if a decryption failure with a given room key
  would have been encountered before the backups were enabled.

### Documentation

- Improve documentation of `Client::observe_events`.


### Features


- Add `create_room_alias` function.

- `Client::cross_process_store_locks_holder_name` is used everywhere:
 - `StoreConfig::new()` now takes a
   `cross_process_store_locks_holder_name` argument.
 - `StoreConfig` no longer implements `Default`.
 - `BaseClient::new()` has been removed.
 - `BaseClient::clone_with_in_memory_state_store()` now takes a
   `cross_process_store_locks_holder_name` argument.
 - `BaseClient` no longer implements `Default`.
 - `EventCacheStoreLock::new()` no longer takes a `key` argument.
 - `BuilderStoreConfig` no longer has
   `cross_process_store_locks_holder_name` field for `Sqlite` and
   `IndexedDb`.

- `EncryptionSyncService` and `Notification` are using `Client::cross_process_store_locks_holder_name`.

- Allow passing a custom `RequestConfig` to an upload request.

- Retry uploads if they've failed with transient errors.

- Implement `EventHandlerContext` for tuples.

- Introduce a mechanism similar to `Client::add_event_handler` and
  `Client::add_room_event_handler` but with a reactive programming pattern. Add
  `Client::observe_events` and `Client::observe_room_events`.

 ```rust
 // Get an observer.
 let observer =
     client.observe_events::<SyncRoomMessageEvent, (Room, Vec<Action>)>();

 // Subscribe to the observer.
 let mut subscriber = observer.subscribe();

 // Use the subscriber as a `Stream`.
 let (message_event, (room, push_actions)) = subscriber.next().await.unwrap();
 ```

 When calling `observe_events`, one has to specify the type of event (in the
 example, `SyncRoomMessageEvent`) and a context (in the example, `(Room,
 Vec<Action>)`, respectively for the room and the push actions).

- Implement unwedging for media uploads.

- Send state from state sync and not from timeline to widget ([#4254](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4254))

- Allow aborting media uploads.

- Add `RoomPreviewInfo::num_active_members`.

- Use room directory search as another data source.

- Check if the user is allowed to do a room mention before trying to send a call
  notify event.
  ([#4271](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4271))

- Add `Client::cross_process_store_locks_holder_name()`.

- Add a `PreviouslyVerified` variant to `VerificationLevel` indicating that the
  identity is unverified and previously it was verified.

- New `UserIdentity::pin` method.

- New `ClientBuilder::with_decryption_trust_requirement` method.

- New `ClientBuilder::with_room_key_recipient_strategy` method

- New `Room.set_account_data` and `Room.set_account_data_raw` RoomAccountData
  setters, analogous to the GlobalAccountData

- New `RequestConfig.max_concurrent_requests` which allows to limit the maximum
  number of concurrent requests the internal HTTP client issues (all others have
  to wait until the number drops below that threshold again)

- Implement proper redact handling in the widget driver. This allows the Rust
  SDK widget driver to support widgets that rely on redacting.


### Refactor
- [**breaking**] Rename `DisplayName` to `RoomDisplayName`.

- Improve `is_room_alias_format_valid` so it's more strict.

- Remove duplicated fields in media event contents.

- Use `SendHandle` for media uploads too.

- Move `event_cache_store/` to `event_cache/store/` in `matrix-sdk-base`.

- Move `linked_chunk` from `matrix-sdk` to `matrix-sdk-common`.

- Move `Event` and `Gap` into `matrix_sdk_base::event_cache`.

- Move `formatted_caption_from` to the SDK, rename it.

- Tidy up and start commenting the widget code.

- Get rid of `ProcessingContext` and inline it in its callers.

- Get rid of unused `limits` parameter when constructing a `WidgetMachine`.

- Use a specialized mutex for locking access to the state store and
  `being_sent`.

- Renamed `VerificationLevel::PreviouslyVerified` to
  `VerificationLevel::VerificationViolation`.

- [**breaking**] Replace the `Notification` type from Ruma in `SyncResponse` and
  `Client::register_notification_handler` by a custom one.

- [**breaking**] The ambiguity maps in `SyncResponse` are moved to `JoinedRoom`
  and `LeftRoom`.

- [**breaking**] `Room::can_user_redact` and `Member::can_redact` are split
  between `*_redact_own` and `*_redact_other`.

- [**breaking**] `AmbiguityCache` contains the room member's user ID.

- [**breaking**] Replace `impl MediaEventContent` with `&impl MediaEventContent` in
  `Media::get_file`/`Media::remove_file`/`Media::get_thumbnail`/`Media::remove_thumbnail`

- [**breaking**] A custom sliding sync proxy set with
  `ClientBuilder::sliding_sync_proxy` now takes precedence over a discovered
  proxy.

- [**breaking**] `Client::get_profile` was moved to `Account` and renamed to
  `Account::fetch_user_profile_of`. `Account::get_profile` was renamed to
  `Account::fetch_user_profile`.

- [**breaking**] The `HttpError::UnableToCloneRequest` error variant has been
  removed because it was never used or generated by the SDK.

- [**breaking**] The `Error::InconsistentState` error variant has been removed
  because it was never used or generated by the SDK.

- [**breaking**] The widget capabilities in the FFI now need two additional
  flags: `update_delayed_event`, `send_delayed_event`.

- [**breaking**] `Room::event` now takes an optional `RequestConfig` to allow
  for tweaking the network behavior.

- [**breaking**] The `instant` module was removed, use the `ruma::time` module
  instead.

- [**breaking**] Add `ClientBuilder::sqlite_store_with_cache_path` to build a
  client that stores caches in a different directory to state/crypto.

- [**breaking**] The `body` parameter in `get_media_file` has been replaced with
  a `filename` parameter now that Ruma has a `filename()` method.

# 0.7.0

Breaking changes:

- The `Client::sync_token` accessor function is no longer public. If you were
  using this for `Client::sync_once()`, you can get the token from the result of
  the `Client::sync_once()` method instead ([#1216](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1216)).
- `Common::members` and `Common::members_no_sync` take a `RoomMemberships` to be able to filter the
  results by any membership state.
  - `Common::active_members(_no_sync)` and `Common::joined_members(_no_sync)` are deprecated.
- `matrix-sdk-sqlite` is the new default store implementation outside of WASM, behind the `sqlite` feature.
  - The `sled` feature was removed. The `matrix-sdk-sled` crate is deprecated and no longer maintained.
- Replace `Client::authentication_issuer` with `Client::authentication_server_info` that contains
  all the fields discovered from the homeserver for authenticating with OIDC
- Remove `HttpSend` trait in favor of allowing a custom `reqwest::Client` instance to be supplied
- Move all the types and methods using the native Matrix login and registration APIs from `Client`
  to the new `matrix_auth::MatrixAuth` API that is accessible via `Client::matrix_auth()`.
- Move `Session` and `SessionTokens` to the `matrix_auth` module.
  - Move the session methods on `Client` to the `MatrixAuth` API.
  - Split `Session`'s content into several types. Its (de)serialization is still backwards
    compatible.
- The room API has been simplified
  - Removed the previous `Room`, `Joined`, `Invited` and `Left` types
  - Merged all of the functionality from `Joined`, `Invited` and `Left` into `room::Common`
  - Renamed `room::Common` to just `Room` and made it accessible as `matrix_sdk::Room`
- Event handler closures now need to implement `FnOnce` + `Clone` instead of `Fn`
  - As a consequence, you no longer need to explicitly need to `clone` variables they capture
    before constructing an `async move {}` block inside
- `Room::sync_members` doesn't return the underlying Ruma response anymore. If you need to get the
  room members, you can use `Room::members` or `Room::get_member` which will make sure that the
  members are up to date.
- The `transaction_id` parameter of `Room::{send, send_raw}` was removed
  - Instead, both methods now return types that implement `IntoFuture` (so can be awaited like
    before) and have a `with_transaction_id` builder-style method
- The parameter order of `Room::{send_raw, send_state_event_raw}` has changed, `content` is now last
  - The parameter type of `content` has also changed to a generic; `serde_json::Value` arguments
    are still allowed, but so are other types like `Box<serde_json::value::RawValue>`
- All "named futures" (structs implementing `IntoFuture`) are now exported from modules named
  `futures` instead of directly in the respective parent module
- `Verification` is non-exhaustive, to make the `qrcode` cargo feature additive

Bug fixes:

- `Client::rooms` now returns all rooms, even invited, as advertised.

Additions:

- Add secret storage support, the secret store can be opened using the
  `Client::encryption()::open_secret_store()` method, which allows you to import
  or export secrets from the account-data backed secret-store.

- Add `VerificationRequest::state` and `VerificationRequest::changes` to check
  and listen to changes in the state of the `VerificationRequest`. This removes
  the need to listen to individual matrix events once the `VerificationRequest`
  object has been acquired.
- The `Room` methods to retrieve state events can now return a sync or stripped event,
  so they can be used for invited rooms too.
- Add `Client::subscribe_to_room_updates` and `room::Common::subscribe_to_updates`
- Add `Client::rooms_filtered`
- Add methods on `Client` that can handle several authentication APIs.
- Add new method `force_discard_session` on `Room` that allows to discard the current
  outbound session (room key) for that room. Can be used by clients for the `/discardsession` command.

# 0.6.2

- Fix the access token being printed in tracing span fields.

# 0.6.1

- Fixes a bug where the access token used for Matrix requests was added as a field to a tracing span.
