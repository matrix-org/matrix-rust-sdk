# Uniffi based bindings for the Rust SDK crypto crate.

This crate contains Uniffi based bindings for the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate. The
README mainly describes how to build and integrate the bindings into a Kotlin
based Android project, but the Android specific bits can be skipped if you are
targeting an x86 Linux project.

## Prerequisites

### Rust

To build the bindings [Rust] will be needed it can be either installed using an
OS specific package manager or directly with the provided [installer](https://rustup.rs/).

### Android NDK

The Android NDK will be required as well, it can be installed either through
Android Studio or directly using an [installer](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads).

### Configuring Rust for cross compilation

First we'll need to install the Rust target for our desired Android architecture,
for example:

```
# rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
```

This will add support to cross-compile for the aarch64-linux-android target,
Rust supports many different [targets], you'll have to make sure to pick the
right one for your device or emulator.

After this is done, we'll have to configure [Cargo] to use the correct linker
for our target. Cargo is configured using a TOML file that will be found in
`%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\config.toml` on Windows or `$HOME/.cargo/config` on Unix
platforms. More details and configuration options for Cargo can be found in the
official docs over [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html).

```
[target.aarch64-linux-android]
ar = "NDK_HOME/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/ar"
linker = "NDK_HOME/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android30-clang"
```

## Building

To enable cross compilation for `olm-sys` which builds our `libolm` C library
we'll need to set the `ANDROID_NDK` environment variable to the location of our
Android NDK installation.

```
$ export ANDROID_NDK=$HOME/Android/Sdk/ndk/22.0.7026061/
```

### Building for a target

The bindings can built for the `aarch64` target with:

```
$ cargo build --target aarch64-linux-android
```

After that, a dynamic library can be found in the `target/aarch64-linux-android/debug` directory.
The library will be called `libmatrix_crypto.so` and needs to be renamed and
copied into the `jniLibs` directory of your Android project, for Element Android:

```
$ cp ../../target/aarch64-linux-android/debug/libmatrix_crypto.so \
     /home/example/matrix-sdk-android/src/main/jniLibs/aarch64/libuniffi_olm.so
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

These crates are built with the Rust language version 2021 and require a minimum compiler version of `1.60`.
