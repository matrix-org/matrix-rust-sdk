Breaking changes:

- The `AuthenticationService` has been removed:
  - Instead of calling `configure_homeserver`, build your own client with the `serverNameOrHomeserverUrl` builder method to keep the same behaviour.
    - The parts of `AuthenticationError` related to discovery will be represented in the `ClientBuildError` returned when calling `build()`.
  - The remaining methods can be found on the built `Client`.
    - There is a new `abortOidcLogin` method that should be called if the webview is dismissed without a callback (or fails to present).
    - The rest of `AuthenticationError` is now found in the OidcError type.
- `OidcAuthenticationData` is now called `OidcAuthorizationData`.
- The `get_element_call_required_permissions` function now requires the device_id.

Additions:

- Add `ClientBuilder::room_key_recipient_strategy`
