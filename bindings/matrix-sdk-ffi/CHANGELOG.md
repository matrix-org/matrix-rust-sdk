Breaking changes:

- `EventSendState` now has two additional variants: `CrossSigningNotSetup` and
  `SendingFromUnverifiedDevice`. These indicate that your own device is not
  properly cross-signed, which is a requirement when using the identity-based
  strategy, and can only be returned when using the identity-based strategy.

  In addition, the `VerifiedUserHasUnsignedDevice` and
  `VerifiedUserChangedIdentity` variants can be returned when using the
  identity-based strategy, in addition to when using the device-based strategy
  with `error_on_verified_user_problem` is set.

- `EventSendState` now has two additional variants: `VerifiedUserHasUnsignedDevice` and
  `VerifiedUserChangedIdentity`. These reflect problems with verified users in the room
  and as such can only be returned when the room key recipient strategy has
  `error_on_verified_user_problem` set.

- The `AuthenticationService` has been removed:
    - Instead of calling `configure_homeserver`, build your own client with the `serverNameOrHomeserverUrl` builder
      method to keep the same behaviour.
        - The parts of `AuthenticationError` related to discovery will be represented in the `ClientBuildError` returned
          when calling `build()`.
    - The remaining methods can be found on the built `Client`.
        - There is a new `abortOidcLogin` method that should be called if the webview is dismissed without a callback (
          or fails to present).
        - The rest of `AuthenticationError` is now found in the OidcError type.
- `OidcAuthenticationData` is now called `OidcAuthorizationData`.
- The `get_element_call_required_permissions` function now requires the device_id.

Additions:

- Add `Encryption::get_user_identity` which returns `UserIdentity`
- Add `ClientBuilder::room_key_recipient_strategy`
